This repository includes python codes (written in jupyter notebook) to apply XGBoost method of machine learning for various tasks
(both regression and classification).
The application of the XGBoost method plus extensive procedure of turing the correlated hyperparameters is discussed eithin the codes.
1. Regression:
machine-learning-using-different-methods-Superconductivty_UCL-data
prediction of critical temperature of a series of supercutors.
The data set as csv file can be downloade here. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data
The extensive explenation plus other machine learning methods applied to this data set can be found in:

2. Classification:
classification-UCL-temperature-of-Gas-Sensors-Array
prediction of the temperature of the array of 14 metal oxide gas sensors.
